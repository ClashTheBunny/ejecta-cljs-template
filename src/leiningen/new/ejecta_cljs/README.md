## EjectaCLJS

Create an `ObjC` directory.

```shell
mkdir ObjC
```

Launch XCode and create a project with the exact same name as the one
you used from Leiningen. It is recommended that you use camel case for
the name to avoid munging.

Initialize your project:

```shell
script/init
```

Start the REPL:

```shell
script/repl
```
